# color-game

I'm making a game about colors, and I figured I'd throw it up on Github because I haven't been very active here recently.
At some point, I may decide to stop updating this repository. If this project goes well, I'd like to submit it to the App Store, and I'd prefer to not have all of the code available to the copy cats!
